<p>Feeling drained, stressed or a little out of focus at the workplace? Here is a way to re-charge yourself.</p>
<p>Presenting &ldquo;Y Break&rdquo;, or the &ldquo;Yoga Break at Workplace&rdquo; program. A thoughtfully designed Yoga protocol from the Ministry of AYUSH to connect you to your breath.</p>
<p>Y Break protocol will help you to de-stress, refresh and re-focus, all during a quick break from work. The 5 minutes time frame with selected Yoga practices is designed to bring the well known rewards of Yoga to you if pursued daily, regularly over a long period.</p>
<p>Y Break Protocol works wonders at the workplace by making it easier to focus on work and increasing the productivity of individuals.</p>
<p>To assess Y break protocol&rsquo;s efficacy, it was put on trials at various corporations and institutions in 6 metropolitan cities with the help of reputed institutions like :</p>
<p>● Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga, New Delhi,</p>
<p>● Krishnamacharya Yoga Mandiram, Chennai,</p>
<p>● Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda Educational and Research Institute, Kolkata,</p>
<p>● NIMHANS, Bengaluru,</p>
<p>● Kaivalyadhama Health and Yoga Research Center, Lonavala-Mumbai and</p>
<p>● Heartfulness Institute, Hyderabad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The protocol comprises a few simple Yoga practices which include Asana (postures), Pranayama (breathing techniques) and Dhyana (meditation). Each minute is a carefully designed component, with details as follows :</p>
<p>● In the first minute, the practitioner starts in a standing position with Urdhva-hastottanasana (lateral bending) followed by Tadasana (upward stretch).</p>
<p>● In the second minute, practice Skandhachalana (shoulder rotation) followed by Uttanamandukasana (shoulder stretch).</p>
<p>● In the third minute, Ardhachakrasana (backward bend) is followed by Padottanasana (forward bend).</p>
<p>● The fourth minute is dedicated to Nadishodhana pranayama (alternate nostril breathing).</p>
<p>● In the fifth minute, Bhramari pranayama (humming bee breathing) followed by Dhyana (meditation).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An exercise to assess the efficacy of the Y Break protocol was taken up, based on a self-report questionnaire with focus on Physical (i.e. Annamayakośa), Energy (i.e. Prāṇamayakośa), Psychological (i.e. Manomayakośa), Intellectual and Social (i.e. Vij&ntilde;ānamayakośa) Spiritual (Ānandamayakośa) and personal wellbeing levels and a 15 days trial was conducted in six leading Institutes of Yoga across the country and 717 participants from different Private/Corporate and Government Organizations participated and completed the trial successfully.</p>
<p>The results of this study showed that Yoga Break protocol can bring improvements in health parameters and work quality of the working population. Hence, it is recommended that Y Break be introduced to all organizations.</p>
